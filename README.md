## Synthetic Pollenizer â€“ Robotic interventions in the real-world ecological systems
http://www.creativeapplications.net/environment/synthetic-pollenizer-robotic-interventions-in-the-real-world-ecological-systems/
The project is is a conceptual intervention in real-world ecological systems using artificial flowers. It is made by different materials and auduino. Using 3D printer to create some complex structures.  Inspired by natural pollenizers, it imitates the process of bees gathering honey in nature, these robotic replicas artificially pollinate bees, integrating into the reproductive cycle of local flora; an initiative into a cybernetic ecology. 

## 3 of the sensors on the Adafruit Sensors guide
### PIR motion sensors
https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor/
PIR motion sensors is for sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range. PIRs are basically made of a pyroelectric sensor, which can detect levels of infrared radiation. So it only can be used to detect the human or other lifes. 

### Photocells

Photocells are sensors that allow you to detect light. It can be used to create switchs and be adjustable resistance.

### (FSRs) Force sensitive resister

FSRs can be used to detect physical pressure. The principle of this device is a pressure-controlled resistor.

# week 3
## Idea: I want to create a daft funk's helmet.(only the part of displaying)
## Why I wanna make it?
I'm a fan of daft punk. I dream to create it a long time. And in this class, I have an opportunity to do it. 
## what is the function of it?
It can show some motion graphic which is record in its memory.
Also it can
