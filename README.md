## Synthetic Pollenizer â€“ Robotic interventions in the real-world ecological systems
http://www.creativeapplications.net/environment/synthetic-pollenizer-robotic-interventions-in-the-real-world-ecological-systems/

The project is is a conceptual intervention in real-world ecological systems using artificial flowers. It is made by different materials and auduino. Using 3D printer to create some complex structures.  Inspired by natural pollenizers, it imitates the process of bees gathering honey in nature, these robotic replicas artificially pollinate bees, integrating into the reproductive cycle of local flora; an initiative into a cybernetic ecology.
