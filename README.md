Find (online) an project of any sort using Arduino that you find interesting. Write a brief description and put a link in the README.md file in your Github repository. - remember I've posted gitHub resources at the bottom/end of class resources.
Read about 3 of the sensors on the Adafruit Sensors guide listed in resources. Describe (briefly) what you've learned in your Github READ.md file.
